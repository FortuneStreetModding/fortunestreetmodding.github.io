This pack was created by Fixed Fun with the help of other members of the Custom Street community. It is not in a complete state but currently replaces a large amount of textures with HD replacements. Will be updated every once in a while.

#### Installation

To install, add the ST7 folder to your Dolphin Texture Load directory. By default: User/Documents/Dolphin Emulator/Load/Textures

Then make sure Load Custom Textures is enabled in Dolphin under Graphics > Advanced.

You'll also want to make sure your graphics are settings are adjusted to make use of the HD Textures by increasing the Internal Resolution under Graphics > Enhancements.
